## Coding style
We chose to abide by the following coding style rules.

1. All classes are contained in the EchoBay namespace
2. Numeric variables are defined in the `EigenConfig.hpp` file
3. Names representing classes must be in Pascal case: `Reservoir`
4. Variables must be in camel case: `myVariable`, method names must be in lower case, using underscores to separate words: `my_method()`
5. Protected variables start with an underscore
